# LinkedList

In this exercise, we use the singly linked lists to maintain two sequences of distinct integers, one in ascending order (denoted as linked list A) and one in descending order (denoted as linked list B). Given a positive integer k, we may pick one integer a from A, and one integer b from B, such that a + b = k. In this problem, you are required to find out how many such pairs exist for the given k and linked lists A and B.
